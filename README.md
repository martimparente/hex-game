# ðŸŽ® Hex Game

A strategic board game implementation with AI players using Minimax and Alpha-Beta pruning algorithms using Prolog.

## ðŸŽ² About the Game

Hex is a two-player abstract strategy board game in which players attempt to connect opposite sides of a rhombus-shaped board made of hexagonal cells. The game was invented by mathematician and poet Piet Hein in 1942 and later rediscovered and popularized by John Nash.
