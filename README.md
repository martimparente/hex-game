# ðŸŽ® Hex Game

A strategic board game implementation with AI players using Minimax and Alpha-Beta pruning algorithms using Prolog.

## ðŸ“‹ Features

### Version 1.0.0
- âœ¨ Two-player support for any board dimension
- ðŸ”„ Refactored game loops with configurable first player
- ðŸ§  Minimax algorithm implementation
- ðŸ§® Alpha-Beta pruning optimization
- ðŸ¤– CPU vs CPU gameplay option
- âœ… Tested configurations:
  - 2x2 board
  - 3x3 board
  - 4x4 board (with Alpha-Beta)
  - After 5x5 board, AI takes too long to make a move


## ðŸ“‹ Requirements

- [SWI-Prolog](https://www.swi-prolog.org/download/stable) (version 9.0.0 or higher recommended)
